# 📈 Tesla Stock Price Forecasting Dashboard
Unlock the future of Tesla stock prices with this dynamic forecasting dashboard! Leveraging a blend of classic statistical models and cutting-edge deep learning, this tool empowers users to explore, compare, and analyze multiple forecasting approaches—all within a sleek, interactive interface.

**🔍 What Makes This Project Unique?
Diverse Forecasting Arsenal:** Combines traditional models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet) with powerful neural networks (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM) for a comprehensive perspective.

**Tailored Comparison Modes:** Instantly toggle between all models or focused pairwise comparisons, such as Actual vs. LSTM, to zero in on performance differences.

**Interactive Visuals with Meaningful Colors:** Each model is distinctly color-coded with a clean legend positioned outside the chart, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation.

**Real-Time Date Filtering:** Choose your date range on-the-fly and watch forecasts adjust seamlessly, enabling temporal deep dives.

**Data Transparency:** Expand raw forecast tables to inspect the numbers behind the graphs, fostering trust and deeper insights.

**Stylish Dark-Themed UI:** Professional aesthetics paired with intuitive layout for a smooth user experience.
